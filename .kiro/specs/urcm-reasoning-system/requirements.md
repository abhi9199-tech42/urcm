## Introduction

The Unified μ-Resonance Cognitive Mesh (URCM) is a frequency-based artificial reasoning system that replaces discrete token-based processing with continuous frequency-based representations. The system uses phoneme-derived base spaces, oscillatory gating mechanisms, and μ-convergence principles to achieve stable semantic understanding through resonance patterns rather than probabilistic token prediction.
