# Design Document: URCM Reasoning System

## Overview

The Unified μ-Resonance Cognitive Mesh (URCM) proposes a different approach from token-based AI systems: a frequency-based, oscillatory reasoning architecture. The system replaces discrete symbolic processing with continuous phoneme-derived representations that achieve semantic understanding through resonance stabilization rather than probabilistic prediction.

The core mechanism is μ-convergence: a process where semantic stability emerges through the interaction of oscillatory nodes, each representing meaning as stable attractor states. This approach addresses common issues in current AI systems including infinite loops, hallucination drift, and vocabulary explosion while providing natural termination conditions and self-correction mechanisms.

## Error Handling

### Error Classification and Recovery

**Frequency Drift Errors:**
- **Detection**: Monitor frequency vector deviation from valid phoneme regions
- **Recovery**: Project drifted vectors back to nearest valid phoneme space
- **Prevention**: Enforce smoothness constraints during path generation

**Semantic Collapse Errors:**
- **Detection**: Reconstruction loss exceeds threshold (L_recon > τ)
- **Recovery**: Apply reconstruction anchoring to restore semantic grounding
- **Prevention**: Continuous validation through reconstruction loop

**Oscillation Desynchronization:**
- **Detection**: Phase coherence drops below critical threshold
- **Recovery**: Global phase reset across all oscillatory components
- **Prevention**: Monitor phase alignment in real-time

**μ-Convergence Failures:**
- **Detection**: Δμ fails to approach zero within timeout
- **Recovery**: Path competition reset with alternative hypotheses
- **Prevention**: Multi-path redundancy and stability monitoring

**Mesh Communication Errors:**
- **Detection**: Node synchronization failure or signal corruption
- **Recovery**: Isolate faulty node, redistribute processing load
- **Prevention**: Redundant mesh connections and signal validation

    def log_error_patterns(self, error_type: str, context: Dict) -> None:
        """Track error patterns for system improvement"""
```

## Testing Strategy

The URCM system requires a dual testing approach combining traditional unit testing with property-based testing to ensure both specific correctness and universal properties hold across the complex oscillatory dynamics.

### Unit Testing Approach

**Component-Level Testing:**
- Test individual components (PhonemeMapper, ResonanceEncoder, etc.) with specific examples
- Validate error handling mechanisms with known failure cases
- Test integration points between system components
- Verify mathematical computations (μ calculation, oscillation dynamics)

**Integration Testing:**
- Test end-to-end processing pipelines with sample inputs
- Validate mesh node communication protocols
- Test error recovery scenarios with simulated failures
- Verify system behavior under various load conditions

### Property-Based Testing Configuration

**Testing Framework:** We will use Hypothesis (Python) for property-based testing, configured with minimum 100 iterations per test to ensure comprehensive coverage of the continuous parameter spaces.

**Test Tagging Format:** Each property test will be tagged with:
```python
# Feature: urcm-reasoning-system, Property {number}: {property_description}
```

**Key Testing Principles:**
- Property tests verify universal behaviors across all valid inputs
- Unit tests validate specific examples and edge cases
- Both approaches are essential for comprehensive validation
- Property tests catch subtle bugs in continuous parameter spaces
- Unit tests provide concrete examples of expected behavior

The combination ensures that the system maintains correctness across the infinite space of possible frequency paths, oscillation states, and reasoning scenarios while also validating specific critical behaviors.

## Correctness Properties

*A property is a characteristic or behavior that should hold true across all valid executions of a system—essentially, a formal statement about what the system should do. Properties serve as the bridge between human-readable specifications and machine-verifiable correctness guarantees.*

The URCM system's correctness is defined through universal properties that must hold across all possible inputs, oscillation states, and reasoning scenarios. These properties ensure the system maintains semantic stability, prevents drift, and achieves reliable termination.

### Property 1: Phoneme-to-Frequency Mapping Consistency
*For any* valid phoneme from the Sanskrit-derived phoneme set, the frequency mapper should produce a vector in K-dimensional space where K ∈ [16, 32], and the mapping should be deterministic and consistent across all invocations.
**Validates: Requirements 1.2**

### Property 2: Frequency Path Smoothness
*For any* sequence of adjacent phonemes, the resulting frequency vectors should satisfy smoothness constraints such that ||f(pi) - f(pj)||² is minimized, ensuring natural transitions in frequency space.
**Validates: Requirements 1.3**

### Property 3: Text-to-Frequency Pipeline Completeness
*For any* valid text input, the complete processing pipeline (text → phoneme sequence → frequency path) should produce a valid frequency path with proper dimensionality and smoothness properties.
**Validates: Requirements 1.4**

### Property 4: μ-Convergence Reasoning Stability
*For any* reasoning scenario with multiple competing paths, the system should calculate μ = ρ/χ for each path, select the path with highest μ-stability, and automatically terminate when Δμ approaches zero, preventing infinite loops.
**Validates: Requirements 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4**

### Property 5: Oscillatory Gating Mathematical Correctness
*For any* resonance state and time t, the oscillatory gating mechanism should apply the correct mathematical transformations: global rhythm g(t) = cos(2πωt) and gated resonance ỹt = yt ⊙ σ(Wg·g(t) + b), creating cyclic cognition patterns.
**Validates: Requirements 3.1, 3.2, 3.3**

### Property 6: Attractor-Based Semantic Representation
*For any* semantic meaning processed by the system, it should be encoded as a stable phase pattern (attractor) where reasoning becomes movement between attractor states, decisions are made through attractor dominance, and eigenvalue control maintains stability (negative eigenvalues = stable beliefs).
**Validates: Requirements 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5**

### Property 7: Decentralized Mesh Privacy Preservation
*For any* communication between mesh nodes, only Δμ and phase alignment signals should be exchanged (never raw data), ensuring privacy protection through local processing while achieving global knowledge emergence through μ pattern synchronization.
**Validates: Requirements 5.2, 5.3, 5.5**

### Property 8: Semantic Latent Space Round-Trip Consistency
*For any* resonance state, the complete round-trip process (resonance state → semantic latent space projection z = S(y) → reconstruction F̂ = D(z)) should minimize reconstruction loss L_recon = ||F̂ - F||₁ and maintain reconstructability with stability across oscillations.
**Validates: Requirements 6.1, 6.3, 6.4, 7.1, 7.2**

### Property 9: Error Recovery and System Stability
*For any* error condition (frequency drift, semantic collapse, or oscillation desync), the system should detect the error and apply the appropriate recovery mechanism (phoneme region projection, reconstruction anchoring, or phase reset) while maintaining overall system stability throughout the recovery process.
**Validates: Requirements 2.5, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5, 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4**

### Property 10: Multi-Path Competition Independence
*For any* set of competing reasoning hypotheses, each should be encoded as an independent resonance path with its own μ-value calculation, and the selection mechanism should choose the highest μ-stability path without interference between paths during parallel evaluation.
**Validates: Requirements 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5**

### Property 11: Computational Efficiency Constraints
*For any* processing operation, the system should operate within specified efficiency bounds: finite phoneme set size, K-dimensional frequency processing where K ∈ [16, 32], compressed semantic latent space, and demonstrate memory efficiency compared to token-based systems.
**Validates: Requirements 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.5**

### Property 12: Mesh Fault Tolerance
*For any* node failure or communication error in the decentralized mesh, the system should continue operating without central authority dependency, maintain scalable processing through the remaining nodes, and provide fault tolerance through redundant mesh connections.
**Validates: Requirements 5.1, 5.4, 10.4**
