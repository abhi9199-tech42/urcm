Metacognition Module: The Left Brain Monitor.

This module implements the "Observer" that watches the Right Brain's stream of consciousness.
It detects:
1. High Entropy (Confusion)
2. Loops (Stagnation)
3. Goal Drift (Distraction)

And triggers control signals (Gain, Noise, Focus) to correct the trajectory.
